# Scratch-game
This is my first project for CS50 (introduction to computer science from Harvard university) on EDX.org.

# Usage 
To play:
  - From here (this repo) download game file (collect-fruit.sb3) to your local computer and open it in https://scratch.mit.edu/ site.
  - or -
  - Go to this url and enjoy https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/301973346/

To see the code:
  - just click on (see inside) button.
  
# What I Learned:
  - how computers represent information in memory (binary representation).
  - computional thinking - algorithms (in other word) the process of creating function and how to think through that process (intelligently first then ).
  - basic programming constructs (functions - conditions - boolean expressions - loops) and how to do something useful with them (creating a game). 
  - learn abstraction (in other word) functions decomposition technique or think in coding process as if consists only from functions.
